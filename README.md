# Notes App

Design and develop a mobile notes app using Flutter that allows users to create,
edit, and manage their personal notes in a convenient and organized manner.
The app should provide a user-friendly interface with intuitive functionalities
to make note-taking efficient and effective for the users. Some of the features
and the issues the app should resolve are:

1. Note creation: The app should allow users to create new notes by providing
   a form where they can enter the note title, description, and any other relevant
   information.

2. Note management: The app should allow users to manage their notes by
   providing a list view where they can view all their notes and search for
   specific notes.

3. Note editing: The app should allow users to edit their notes, by providing
   an interface where they can modify the content of their notes.

4. Note styling: The app allows us to add various styles and colors to our notes
   to differentiate between them easily.

5. User-Friendly UI/UX: The app should have a clean, visually appealing,
   and intuitive user interface that provides a seamless and efficient user
   experience. Users should be able to easily navigate the app, create, edit, and
   manage notes with minimal effort, and find relevant features quickly.

6. Offline Support: The app should provide offline support, allowing users to
   create, edit, and view notes even when they are not connected to the internet.
   The app should automatically sync with the cloud and update the data when
   the device is online again
